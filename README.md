# AI-Powered Sign Language Translator

This project aims to create an AI-powered application that translates sign language into text and speech, and vice versa.

## Core Features
- **Sign Language to Text/Speech:**
  - Real-time sign language gesture recognition using a camera.
  - Utilizes a trained AI model to convert gestures into text or speech.
- **Text/Speech to Sign Language:**
  - Converts spoken or written language into animated sign language gestures using avatars or pre-recorded videos.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Frontend:**
  - Framework: React (web app) or React Native (mobile app).
  - Camera Integration: WebRTC or getUserMedia API.
  - Speech-to-Text API: Google Speech-to-Text, Azure Cognitive Services, or Whisper.
  - Text-to-Speech API: Google Text-to-Speech, Amazon Polly, or Azure TTS.
- **Backend:**
  - Language Processing: Python (Flask/Django/FastAPI).
  - Sign Recognition: TensorFlow, PyTorch, or OpenCV.
  - Database: MongoDB or Firebase.
- **AI Models:**
  - Pre-trained sign language recognition models (e.g., ASL, BSL).
  - Custom models trained using labeled sign language datasets.
- **Deployment:**
  - Web App: Vercel, Netlify, or AWS.
  - Mobile App: Expo for React Native, App Store, or Google Play.
  - Cloud Model Hosting: AWS Sagemaker, Google AI Platform, or Hugging Face Spaces.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Research and Planning**
   - Identify the specific sign language (e.g., ASL, BSL, or regional languages).
   - Define the scope (e.g., word-level translation or complete sentences).
2. **Build the Frontend**
   - Create a UI with React or React Native.
   - Integrate real-time video feed using WebRTC or getUserMedia.
3. **Gesture Recognition**
   - Use MediaPipe Hands or OpenPose for hand tracking.
   - Train a CNN/LSTM model for gesture classification.
4. **Text/Speech to Sign Language**
   - Implement a Text-to-Sign feature using a database of pre-recorded sign language videos or a 3D avatar.
5. **Real-Time Translation**
   - Combine models for real-time translation.
6. **Backend and Cloud Integration**
   - Store user preferences and translation logs in the database.
   - Host the AI model on a cloud platform for scalability.

## Datasets
- ASL Dataset: RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T.
- MediaPipe Hands: Built-in hand tracking for gesture landmarks.
- Sign Language MNIST: A dataset of ASL alphabets.
- Google AI Datasets: Pre-trained sign recognition models.
- Kaggle: Search for sign language datasets.
